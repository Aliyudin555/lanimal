    <b>Pigs: Intelligent and Versatile Animals</b><br>
    Pigs are livestock that are widely kept and known throughout the world. They are members of the Suidae family and are known for their intelligence, versatility, and contributions to various cultures and livestock systems. Here is a brief overview of pigs:
<br><b>Physical Characteristics</b><br>
Pigs have fat bodies with short legs and tails that are often curled. They have thick skin covered with coarse bristles, although some pig breeds have less fur. Pig skin color can vary from pale pink to brown and black, depending on the breed. Pigs also have very sensitive noses and use them to search for food on the ground.
<br><b>Habitat and Distribution</b><br>
The domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) is found throughout the world, with significant populations in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. They are generally kept on farms, but there are also populations of wild pigs living in forests and grasslands.

<br><b>Behavior and Eating Habits</b><br>
Pigs are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. They have a varied diet that includes grains, fruits, vegetables, and meat. Pigs are known for their ability to find food by sniffing the ground with their noses. They are social animals that live in groups called "sounders," which usually consist of females and their young.
<br><b>Intelligence</b><br>
Pigs are one of the most intelligent livestock animals. They have high learning abilities, can recognize faces, and are even able to solve simple problems. Studies show that pigs have intelligence levels comparable to dogs and small children.
<br><b>Reproduction</b><br>
Pigs have high reproductive capabilities. A female, called a "sow," can give birth to up to 12 young, called "piglets," in one birth. Piglets grow quickly and are weaned after a few weeks. Pigs can breed several times a year, making them very productive livestock.
<br><b>Role in Culture and Economy</b><br>
Pigs have an important role in many cultures. In some places, pork is the main source of protein and a basic ingredient in many traditional dishes. In addition, pigs are also used in medical research because their physiology is similar to humans. Pigskin is used for a variety of products, including bandages and medical equipment.
<br><b>Interesting Facts about Pigs</b><br>
